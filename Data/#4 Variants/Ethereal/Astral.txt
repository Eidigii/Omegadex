Astral creatures have the ability to leave their body, moving around in the Astral plane.
Passing through enemeis will debuff them in several ways, giving either you, or allies, an

Pressing Prone(X) will allow you to enter Astral form. You cannot attack, take, or deal
damage. Wild dinos will ignore you unless already aggroed to you. Passing through enemies
