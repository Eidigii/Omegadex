<span style="color:lightgray;">Spectral</span>: These have the ability to go invisible on command, preventing wild creatures from
seeing them. This ability has no cooldown, but instead drains stamina over time. Hitting
zero stamina will cause them to uncloak. An additional perk of Spectral creatures is that
they have a chance to dodge damage entirely while invisible, and allow riders to use
weapons while mounted. Hitting a wild Spectral will cause it to flee, only to return when it
uncloaks.

Pressing Prone(X) will cause them to instantly cloak, and pressing it again will uncloak.
There is no cooldown on this ability.
