<span style="color:gray;">Reflective</span>: Reflective creatures are another form of punishment. While reflection is active,
Reflective creatures will only take a portion of the damage, while the rest is reflected
directly back to the attacker. This opens up strategies like being able to heal while reflect is
active, and still being able to injure the attacker.

Pressing Prone(X) will activate Reflection, surrounded you in a razor sharp shards and
forcing the attacker to injure himself when dealing damage.
