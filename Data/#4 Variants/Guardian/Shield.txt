<span style="color:gray;">Shield</span>: These are portable Tek Shields. They create a rapidly expanding shield that gives
asylum to all nearby allies, keeping enemies out. As the shield expands it will push enemies
away, making sure none are trapped within.

Pressing Prone (X) will create an expanding Tek Shield, pushing away enemies and
protecting allies. Nothing can pass through the shield, not even projectiles.
