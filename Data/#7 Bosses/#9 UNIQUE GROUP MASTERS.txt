Unique Group Gods:
Unique Group Gods are the end-game bosses. They take things significantly further than Group Gods. They
have Group Variants, but 2 of them. They get the stat multipliers of both applied to the Group God base stats. To
Summon one, put the 2 matching Group God Soul sin the Omega Altar. Be warned, only top-tier creatures can
survive more than a few seconds against these. This would include Apex Predators (Rex, Spino, Giga, etc) with
many Paragon Levels, Godlike Group variant tameable bosses, or Godlike Uniques with many paragon levels.

Current List, plus Stat Multiplier:
-Apocalypse: Cosmic/Nature: 36x
-Anima: Mythical/Summoner: 64x
-Alchemy: Unstable/Elemental: 48x
-Indestructus: Guardian/Resource: 30x
-Infinity: Ethereal/Utility: 2x
-Sin: Nightmare/Rage: 384x

Upon killing them, they will drop a bright shining soul on the ground. Feeding this soul to a group variant from
which the God was made (Example: Apocalypse Soul to a Cosmic or Nature creature) will rank it up to Ancient
Tier, providing a massive stat bonus and allow it to damage the final boss.
