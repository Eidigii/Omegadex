Unique Gods:
The Unique Gods server a single purpose, ranking up your Omega Unique creatures to Godlike. After you tame
a Unique, you can use the Soul Grinder and Rank Up tokens to upgrade it to Omega, if it was a lesser tier when
tamed.

Unique Gods can be summoned by crafting the token in the Soul Grinder using a paragon soul of the species
you're wanting to rank up to Godlike.

Unique Gods will match their Unique creatures. For example: The Unique Coelacanth is Static, a fish made of
lightning with both Lightning and Wind variants. The Coelacanth God is a massive Coelacanth, who looks much
like Static and has both the Lightning and Wind variants.
