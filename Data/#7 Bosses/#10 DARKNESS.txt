Lucky Gods:
World Bosses, based completely around Lucky Variants. These can only spawn in at Omega Beacons, and
have a chance to spawn only every 3 hours.

The chance to spawn one is based on how many wild ones have been killed. Killing a wild Lucky variant
increases the chance of a god spawning at that tier by 1%, such as killing a wild Omega Loot dino will increase
the chance of spawning an Omega Loot God by 1% at the end of the timer.

The chances of these spawning does not decrease until one has spawned, and that tier will have its spawn
chance reduced back to 0%.

Killing them gives rewards very similar to killing a wild Lucky variant, only greatly magnified.
