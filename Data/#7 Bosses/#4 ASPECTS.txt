Group Gods:
Group Gods are the late-game bosses. They are incredibly powerful, and have the abilities of all 6 variants,
often the God versions, with additional twists. Killing them is meant to be a raid, and killing them with just a
single creature is very unlikely. Strategy is a must, and fighting them in tribes or even with allied tribes will make
these fights considerably easier.

Upon killing them, they will drop a bright shining soul on the ground. This soul is the greatest upgrade you will
give your creature. Feeding this soul to a Godlike within that group will give it the ability of the group god. This
ability, while often incredibly overpowered, is your reward for killing these bosses. Wild enemies will not stand a
chance against you. But something else might...
